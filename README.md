# Karadana-Tea-Factory-Management-System
This mobile application is designed to improve the integrity and efficiency of the tea factory supply chain by addressing challenges such as weight manipulation by suppliers. The app incorporates advanced AI/ML technologies and digital weighing systems to ensure accurate, transparent, and accountable processes.

Features:
1. Real-Time Weight Verification
Description: Verify the weight of tea leaves in real time at the point of arrival, both at collection points and the factory.
Key Benefit: Detect large discrepancies between initial and final weight, ensuring accuracy.
2. AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
Description: Analyze historical weight data using AI to identify anomalies and predict tampering or unusual patterns in the supply chain.
Key Benefit: Detect and prevent malicious practices, ensuring a secure supply chain.
3. Supplier Performance Analytics
Description: A comprehensive dashboard that tracks and analyzes supplier performance over time, focusing on metrics such as reliability, weight discrepancies, and adherence to schedules.
Key Benefit: Optimize supplier relationships by identifying and addressing performance issues.
4. Automated Workflow for Issue Resolution
Description: Automatically initiates a predefined workflow when a weight discrepancy or other issue is detected.
Key Benefit: Ensures swift action is taken to resolve issues, reducing operational delays and financial losses.
5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Supplier Management Portal
Description: Implement user roles (factory manager, supplier, auditor) with access controls to various app features. Suppliers can manage profiles, review performance, and communicate with the factory via a dedicated portal.
Key Benefit: Ensures a controlled, secure, and organized system for all stakeholders.
6. Mobile Notifications and Alerts
Description: Receive real-time notifications for critical events such as detected anomalies, emergency communications, and system updates.
Key Benefit: Stay informed and responsive to critical supply chain events.

Technologies Used:
AI/ML: For anomaly detection and predictive analytics
Digital Weighing Systems: To ensure accurate weight recording
Mobile Technologies: For real-time data capture and notifications

How It Works:
Tea leaves are weighed at the collection point and the data is recorded in real time.
AI models compare current and historical data to detect any anomalies.
In case of discrepancies, the app triggers an automated workflow for resolution.
Factory managers and suppliers can access a dashboard to monitor performance and maintain transparent communication.
